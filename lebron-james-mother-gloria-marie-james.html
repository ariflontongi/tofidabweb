Having played for the <a href=#>Cleveland Cavaliers</a>, <a href=#>Miami Heat</a>, and the LA Lakers, James is the only player to win the NBA Finals MVP with 3 different franchises. His agile and versatile style of playing has led many to draw comparisons with greats such as <a href=#>Magic Johnson</a>, <a href=#>Michael Jordan</a>, and <a href=#>Oscar Robertson</a>.</span></p><h2 id=lebron-james-mother-gloria-marie-james-0><strong>Who is LeBron James mom, Gloria James?</strong></h2><figure class=image contenteditable=false></figure><p><span>Gloria Marie James was born on February 4th, 1968.

She was only 16 when she gave birth to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LeBron James</a>.</span></p><p><span>At the age of 19, her mom who was her main support while raising LeBron James passed away due to a sudden heart attack. She was left to take care of her young child and two brothers. She struggled financially and often had to keep shifting homes to take up jobs. Gloria had not completed her education due to her pregnancy, which was why she was unable to find a stable job. After a point, she realized that it was futile for her to keep moving with a young child and took the hardest decision of her life by deciding to leave him with his then football coach, Frank Walker, who was the one who introduced LeBron to basketball. She was quoted saying "It was hard, but it was not about me. it was about him. At that time in life, he needed stability."</span></p><p><span>Fast-forward to a few years later, in 2003, a few months before his draft into the NBA, LeBron James’ mom Gloria gifted him a Hummer H2 which cost around $50,000 for his birthday. Reports stated that she had taken a loan to gift him the expensive vehicle, which caused quite a stir, and investigations were carried to ascertain the funding for the lavish gift. However, nothing came of the investigations. </span><span>Gloria James </span><span>has over 500K Instagram followers, and over 300K Twitter followers.
