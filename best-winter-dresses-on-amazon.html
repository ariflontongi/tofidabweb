(And you're willing to splurge—consult our list of the&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/g23400388/cute-winter-dresses/>best winter dresses,</a> full stop.)</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-to-look-for><span>What to Look For</span></h2><ul><li><strong>Materials. </strong>Generally speaking, wintertime typically sees snow and chilly temperatures, so a thicker material is more likely to keep you warm. For winter dresses, consider a sweater style or rib-knit as these are typically made of thicker fabrics. Try to find wool or a wool-blend fabric in your dress for an extra-cozy fit, but materials like viscose, acrylic, and polyester can have a similar effect and are much more affordable.</li><li><strong>Ability to layer</strong>. From my time living in the Midwest and New York City, both of which have dreadful winters, I learned that successful dressing for the weather is all about layers. When it's especially cold out, you need to be able to throw on base layers as well as a good winter coat and scarf. With this in mind, it's best if your winter dress has a loose enough fit for thin layers underneath, but isn't oversized to the point where you can't put on a coat.</li><li><strong>Length. </strong>You may be thinking that come wintertime, you can only wear long dresses. Of course, it's true that maxi styles will provide more coverage, and in effect more warmth, but with the addition of tights or fleece-lined leggings, mini lengths can work just as well in the winter. Consider your plans for the day (for example, will you be walking around in the cold or are you heading to the office?) and your options for accessorizing before you limit your options to a length.</li></ul><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-best-winter-dresses-on-amazon><span>The Best Winter Dresses on Amazon</span></h2><a href=# data-model-name="The Drop Renata Rib Midi Dress" data-url=https://www.amazon.com/Drop-Womens-Renata-Dress-Mocha/dp/B095J8JHSV? referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FDrop-Womens-Renata-Dress-Mocha%2Fdp%2FB095J8JHSV%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5x3AcZCRi3cDNQNPYdEmCi-1920-80.png><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Midi Winter Dress on Amazon</span></p></a><p>The Drop Renata Rib Midi Dress</p><p>Meet your next favorite winter dress.
