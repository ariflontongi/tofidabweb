Valerie,</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>You Know I’m No Good</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;She also won several awards including six Grammys.&nbsp;Unfortunately, Winehouse died at the age of 27, robbing the world of a beautiful voice.&nbsp;Find out more about her here, including cause of death, net worth, etc.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Amy Winehouse Bio (age)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Amy Jade Winehouse was born on September 14, 1983 in North London.&nbsp;Her father, Mitch Winehouse, was a taxi driver and music lover, while her mother, Janis, was a pharmacist.&nbsp;She had an older brother named Alex and her family was Jewish.</span></p><p><span>Weinhaus fell in love with jazz music at an early age thanks to her parents and her paternal grandmother (Cynthia) who was a singer.&nbsp;At her grandmother’s suggestion, Winehouse was enrolled in various theater schools to hone her skills.&nbsp;At the age of 15, the singer left school and began writing music.&nbsp;She worked various jobs to pay the bills and sing in a local band.</span></p><p><span>Amy Winehouse ended up recording a demo tape and her best friend sent it to a talent scout.&nbsp;The scout was impressed by her voice and made efforts to secure a record deal for her.&nbsp;Winehouse later signed to Island Records and released her debut album in 2003 at the age of 20.&nbsp;The album, entitled&nbsp;</span><span>Frank</span><span>&nbsp;, made it to the top of the UK charts and was nominated for the 2004 Mercury Music Prize for Best Album.&nbsp;The London native released her second album,&nbsp;</span><span>Back to Black</span><span>, in 2007. It was even more successful than the first, winning Winehouse several awards including the Grammy for Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Pop Vocal Album.&nbsp;</span><span>Back to Black</span><span>&nbsp;In the end, it would be the last album Winehouse would release in her lifetime.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong></h2><p><span>At the time of her death, Winehouse’s estate was valued at $6.7 million.&nbsp;She left no will and her money went to her parents, with her father being appointed executor of her estate.&nbsp;Her estate should have been worth a lot more considering her successful career, but she is said to have spent large sums on her drug habits and charities.</span></p><span>After her death, her family formed the Amy Winehouse Foundation.&nbsp;The charity provides support to disadvantaged and vulnerable young people, particularly those dealing with substance abuse and emotional issues.</span><h2><strong><span>Amy Winehouse’s husband/boyfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>Amy Winehouse dated quite a few people in the course of her life.&nbsp;They include British singer-songwriter Alex Clare (2006), English actor Josh Bowman (2009) and British film director Reg Traviss (from 2010 until her death in 2011).</span></p><p><span>Her most famous relationship, however, was with Blake Fielder-Civil, a former production assistant and high school dropout.&nbsp;They met at a bar in 2005 and dated before tying the knot in 2007.&nbsp;It was a toxic relationship as Fielder-Civil was both a drug user and a felon.&nbsp;He was in prison for various felonies and admitted to being the person who introduced Winehouse to cocaine and heroin.&nbsp;The pair also fell out, they were once photographed walking the streets of London looking bloody and bruised.&nbsp;Fielder-Civil filed for divorce in January 2009 citing adultery.&nbsp;It was completed in July 2009.</span></p><h2><strong><span>cause of death</span></strong></h2><p><span>Amy Winehouse died at her home in Camden, London on July 23, 2011. Her death was due to alcoholism.&nbsp;At the time of her death, her blood alcohol level was five times the legal drinking limit.&nbsp;Three bottles of vodka (1 small and 2 large) were recovered from the room where her body was found.</span></p><p><span>Winehouse’s death has been described as a modern day tragedy.&nbsp;She found fame at a young age, turning to alcohol and drugs to meet the demands of fame.&nbsp;She would often show up to shows obviously intoxicated, forgetting the lines to her own songs.&nbsp;This left her audience dissatisfied and she was sometimes booed off the stage.&nbsp;Her addiction was reportedly sparked by the death of her beloved grandma in mid-2006.&nbsp;Though she went to rehab often, she wouldn’t let go of the habit.&nbsp;Winehouse even admitted to using drugs in rehab.&nbsp;Her substance abuse was further complicated by other serious psychological issues such as bulimia, self-harm, and depression.</span></p><p><span>Winehouse’s funeral was held in north London on 26 July 2011 and she was later cremated.&nbsp;She died at the age of 27 and joined the 27 Club – a group of well-known figures in the entertainment industry who died at the age of 27.&nbsp;Other members of the club include Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison.&nbsp;Despite her untimely death, Winehouse has influenced an entire generation of artists like Adele, Lady Gaga, John Legend, Lana del Rey, Bruno Mars, Emeli Sande, Jessie J., Alessia Cara, etc.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height</span></strong></h2><p><span>Amy Winehouse was 5 feet 3 inches tall and weighed 50 kg.&nbsp;She struggled with bulimia most of her life and this was the reason for her thin physique.&nbsp;Her eyes were brown while her hair color was black.&nbsp;Winehouse was popular for her signature look of bold red lipstick, over-the-top eyeliner, and beehive hairstyle.&nbsp;This look was influenced by the Latinas she had seen in Miami.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiZna56uLXNnp%2BoraOaeqnB0puYp5xdl7y6stGinKecXZa0pnnHnqCgoKRisKLB0p5kqJ5dmbKiwMdmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ann-blyth-net-worth-127301.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ann Blyth Net Worth</a>
