The sisters, whose parents are Dave and Jarnette, also share an older brother, Trent, and two younger half-siblings, Taylor and Jake, from their father's second marriage.

He's included in the classic&nbsp;You're Invited to Mary-Kate & Ashley's Sleepover Party&nbsp;and this reporter's personal favorite installment of&nbsp;The Adventures of Mary-Kate & Ashley&nbsp;series, "The Case of the U.S. Space Camp Mission," among others, and also had an uncredited bit role in an episode of&nbsp;Full House.</p><p>Trent, who goes by his middle name and whose actual first name, James, was the partial inspiration for his sisters' Elizabeth and James lifestyle brand, has since written several&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel=nofollow data-url=https://freshcomics.us/creator/trent-olsen referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>comics</a>.

After getting their start at nine months sharing the role of Michelle Tanner on&nbsp;Full House, MK&A (or, rather, their parents) capitalized on their cuteness to launch media conglomerate Dualstar, through which they produced movies, TV shows, books, home decor, and more. Once they'd successfully conquered the media world as bona fide mini-moguls, they attended New York University and now focus primarily on developing their award-winning couture label The Row.</p><h2 id=elizabeth-olsen-3>Elizabeth Olsen</h2><p>Though Elizabeth became known around the world for taking on the role of Wanda Maximoff, aka the Scarlet Witch, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe beginning in 2015, her breakthrough role actually came several years earlier, when she received critical acclaim for her performance in the lead role of 2011's&nbsp;Martha Marcy May Marlene.</p><p>Like her older sisters, Elizabeth attended New York University; she graduated in 2013. And, like Trent, she appeared as herself in several productions from the Mary-Kate and Ashley golden age, including four installments of&nbsp;The Adventures of Mary-Kate & Ashley&nbsp;and a brief spot in&nbsp;How the West Was Fun.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

"I couldn't walk in a room without everyone already having an opinion. The thing about nepotism is the fear that you don't earn or deserve the work. There was even a part of me when I was a little girl that thought if I'm gonna be an actress I'm going to go by Elizabeth Chase, which is my middle name," she said.</p><h2 id=courtney-taylor-olsen-3>Courtney Taylor Olsen</h2><p>Though Courtney, the elder four Olsens' half-sister from their dad's marriage to McKenzie Olsen, sadly missed out on her chance to appear in any of Mary-Kate and Ashley's classic VHS tapes, she has dabbled in acting. According to her IMDb page, under the name Taylor Olsen, she appeared in&nbsp;YOLO: The Movie&nbsp;and&nbsp;Malignant Spirits: Sense of Fiction&nbsp;several years ago.</p><p>Though she hasn't spoken publicly about her famous family, Courtney has been known to show them some love on Instagram—like when she posted a sweet photo of herself admiring Elizabeth's face on the&nbsp;Avengers: Infinity War&nbsp;poster at the film's world premiere in 2018.</p><h2 id=jake-olsen-3>Jake Olsen</h2><p>Last but not least is Jake, the youngest Olsen kid and the second of Dave's children with his second wife. Unlike the rest of his family, Jake has yet to try his hand at acting, but he did dabble in modeling for several years.</p><p>He's also been more forthcoming about being a part of his famous family: In a 2016&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener" data-url=https://www.magzter.com/stories/Fashion/Runway/Jake-Olsen referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=skimlinks data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1662120&xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.magzter.com%2Fstories%2FFashion%2FRunway%2FJake-Olsen&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marieclaire.com%2Fculture%2Fa35523279%2Felizabeth-olsen-family" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - magzter.com" data-merchant-id=undefined data-merchant-url=undefined data-merchant-network=undefined>interview</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;Runway&nbsp;magazine, Jake said, "I learned about respect from everyone in my family.

He added, "We all support each other's dreams."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRomGxtZWeAc4OYaJyloaqWr6bAx2ampauVo3qnrcyio7Jn</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-are-maite-perroni-parents-meet-javier-perroni-and-maite-beorlegui-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who are Maite Perroni Parents?
