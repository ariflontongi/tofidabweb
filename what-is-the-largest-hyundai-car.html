This 3-row crossover is the brand's biggest SUV, with seating for eight (seven when configured with 2nd-row captain's chairs).</span></span><h2>Which Hyundai has the most room?</h2>With three comfortable rows, the 2022 Hyundai Palisade is one of the largest SUVs in the market. Although you will find other SUVs with three rows, the 2022 Hyundai Palisade has the most generous headroom and legroom in the segment. Usually, passengers in the last row are not as comfortable as the first two rows.<h2>What is the largest Hyundai SUV made?</h2>The 2022 Hyundai Palisade is a three-row midsize SUV sold in four trims: SE, SEL, Limited and Calligraphy. All are powered by a 3.8-liter V6 (291 horsepower, 262 lb-ft of torque) that is paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is an option on all trims.<h2>Which is larger Hyundai Santa Fe vs Tucson?</h2>While both the Tucson and the Santa Fe are compact SUVs, one is a little bigger than the other. The Santa Fe's 108.9-inch wheelbase just beats out the Tucson's 105.5-inch wheelbase, and it's about 10 inches longer overall, as well as a little bit wider than the newer Tucson.<h2>Does Hyundai have a full size SUV?</h2>The three-row Palisade is Hyundai's largest SUV, slotting in just above the Hyundai Santa Fe.<h2>Do You Know How Big The Hyundai Company?</h2><p></p><h2>Is there a 7 seater Hyundai?</h2>The Hyundai Alcazar has been launched in India. The Creta-based SUV is available in six-seat and seven-seat configurations across three variants that include Prestige, Platinum, and Signature. Bookings for the Alcazar are open for an amount of Rs 25,000.<h2>Which Hyundai has 3rd-row?</h2>There are currently three new Hyundai SUVs that offer 3rd-row seating as standard; the Hyundai Palisade SE, Hyundai Palisade SEL, and the top-of-the-line Hyundai Palisade Limited.<h2>Is Tucson or Kona bigger?</h2>Those wanting the bigger of these two SUVs will want the Tucson. At 176.2-inches, it is just over a foot longer than the Kona, which measures in at 164-inches even. The width of these two vehicles is closer, with the Tucson being 72.8-inches when not including the mirrors and the Kona being 70.9-inches.<h2>Is Santa Fe or Palisade bigger?</h2>Not only is the Palisade larger than the Santa Fe, but it has eight seats and a look that should scare anybody that sees it in their rear vision mirror.<h2>Which Hyundai SUV has the most cargo space?</h2>The 2021 Hyundai Palisade boasts 86.4 cubic feet of cargo room, making it one of the best midsize SUVs with the most cargo room, according to Consumer Reports.<h2>Does Hyundai have a full size car?</h2>As noted earlier, Hyundai has a luxury brand, Genesis. And it offers a full-size sedan, the G90. Since it's a luxury car, the 2022 Genesis G90 is significantly pricier than the 2022 Hyundai Sonata. You could buy two fully-loaded 2022 Sonata Limiteds for roughly the same price as one base 2022 G90 3.3T RWD Premium.<h2>What Hyundai is bigger than a Santa Fe?</h2>Interestingly, the Tucson offers a bit more legroom. Both Hyundai models are close in height, wheelbase, and head and legroom measurements. But the Santa Fe is longer, wider, and about 300 pounds heavier. It also provides more cargo space.<h2>Is the Hyundai Palisade considered a full size SUV?</h2>Compared to a standard SUV, a full-size SUV stands out with its 3rd-row seating feature. The Palisade is a full-size SUV built with comfort and luxury in mind. Not only is it able to easily sit seven or eight passengers, but it will still have room for any additional cargo items.<h2>Is the Santa Fe bigger than the Santa Fe sport?</h2>The Hyundai Santa Fe is also more spacious, with 80 cubic ft. of total cargo space versus the Santa Fe Sport's 71.5 cubic feet. The Santa Fe also features seating for seven passengers while the Santa Fe Sport seats five.<h2>Is the Tucson or Santa Fe better?</h2>The 2021 Tucson is more affordable and offers many of the same safety features as the Santa Fe but the Santa Fe is larger, offers larger engine options, and comes standard with more safety features. Both vehicles are excellent options and the decision ultimately comes down to price.<h2>Is the Santa Fe bigger than the rogue?</h2>In terms of length, the Santa Fe is a bit bigger. It has an overall length of 188.4 inches, and the length of the Rogue is 183 inches. The Santa Fe is a few inches wider as well.<h2>How much is a fully loaded Hyundai Palisade?</h2>How Much Does the Hyundai Palisade Cost? The base Palisade starts at $33,150. That's a typical starting price for the class. The top-of-the-line Palisade Calligraphy trim retails for $46,690.<h2>Is Palisade worth the money?</h2>Is the 2021 Hyundai Palisade worth the money? Consumer Reports thought the 2021 Hyundai Palisade was a solid choice. The critics gave it a score of 84 out of 100 overall and gave it the recommended stamp of approval. The Palisade came in only after the 2021 Kia Telluride on the list of midsized SUVs with three rows.<h2>Is the Santa Fe or Palisade better?</h2>While every Hyundai SUV is a bargain compared to its competitors, the smaller and more nimble Santa Fe is less expensive than its larger counterpart. The Palisade seats up to eight, and has a 3.8L V6 as standard, meaning it is much more vehicle, which justifies the higher cost for those who need the space.<h2>What costs more Hyundai Santa Fe or Tucson?</h2>However, both are available at affordable prices that most people can make fit their budget with the right financing. The 2017 Hyundai Tucson starts at $22,700, and the 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport starts at $25,350.<h2>Is the Hyundai Kona roomy?</h2>Up to five people can sit inside the Kona. The front seats are spacious, comfortable and supportive, but the rear seats are cramped for most adults.<h2>Does Hyundai make an 8 passenger vehicle?</h2>In its 2021 Hyundai lineup, the automaker has introduced an even more upscale version of its popular flagship SUV. With an even more premium feel, smart designs, and plush interior, the 2021 Hyundai Palisade delivers what it promises.<h2>Is the Hyundai Tucson 3rd-row?</h2>The Tucson is a 2-row SUV and a 2-and 3-row version of the Santa Fe is available. The 2018 Hyundai Tucson is a recipient of our 2018 Teens Best New Cars Award and has been a finalist for our 2018 Best Compact SUV for the Money Award.<h2>Are Hyundai Santa Fe 3rd-row?</h2>While the answer to the question “Do all Hyundai Santa Fe models have a 3rd-row seat?” is still “no,” the interior layout of this model will allow you to carry five passengers in comfort and style.
