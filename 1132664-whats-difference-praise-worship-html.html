It is defined as the feeling or expression of reverence and adoration for a deity. Christian worship can then be defined as reverence and adoration for God.</p><p class=align-left>The Greek word that is most often translated as worship in the New Testament is known as "prosumer", which means to "fall down before or bow down before" or "to kiss the hand to (towards) one, in token of reverence".</p><p class=align-left>It was used as homage shown to men and beings of a superior rank. The Hebrew word for worship in the Bible is "Shaha", which means "to bow low or to prostrate oneself".</p><p class=align-left>What is the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">meaning of praise</a>? It is defined as the expression of one's gratitude and respect towards a deity, especially in a song. <a href=#>Christian praise</a> can be defined as the expression of gratitude and respect towards God, especially in a song.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ee976fdf18fd97df.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Gospel singer Frank Edwards sparks reactions as he compares himself to Yahoo boys: "I am richer than all of them"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>There are three Hebrew words in the Bible that are translated as praise. One is "yadah", which means "praise or give thanks or confess". Another one is "Samar", which means "sing praise", and "halal" (which is the root word for hallelujah), which means to praise, honour, or commend.</p><h3>What's the difference between worship and praise?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b6098d69e593b931.jpg><p class=align-left>Most people see worship as slow and melodic songs that often require the closing of eyes, and lifting of hands in reverence to God, while praise is considered as the singing of fast songs and dancing to God.</p><p class=align-left>However, these two words mean more than just songs or singing; they are two different things. Worship completely differs from praise, but praise can be a part of worship.</p><p class=align-left>Praise is <a href=#>appreciating God</a>, especially in songs. It is joyfully recounting everything that God has done and showing him gratitude for it. Praise usually goes along with thanksgiving, appreciating God for all the might and good works He has done in our lives.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3efd62993a55d829.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>“I was sacked from church after I had stuff going on with 4 choristers”: Singer Olakira opens up, causes stir</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Praise is a universal thing and can be applied to anybody. It doesn't require much from us other than the acknowledgement of the righteous acts of God. Praise is usually presented as highly-spirited, joyful and uninhibited in the Bible. God asks all creation to praise him.</p><p class=align-left>Worship, on the other hand, goes deeper than praise. It is something that comes from the Spirit. It is often said that it is an attitude or state of the heart. In the Bible, Jesus spoke about worship in John 4, verse 23.</p>Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.<p class=align-left>Worship for Christians goes beyond singing. Songs are just tools for worshipping. Praise stems from recognizing the good acts of God, but worship is not a function of the acts of God. Worship comes from the core of who the worshipper is and what God means to them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/64c13af0971efbcb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"His answer was correct": Teacher under fire for scoring pupil 0 in exam, photo of question paper trends</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In true worship, Christians must surrender themselves to God and adore Him for what He has done and who He is.</p><p class=align-left>Worship involves bowing low before the Lord, physically and in the heart. Real and true worship is insightful and reflective.</p><p class=align-left>Worship is a lifestyle that is not just limited to when people raise their hands to sing to God in church. And praise comes from a heart of worship.</p><p class=align-left>Praise and worship are not limited to just Christians. People sing praises of other people also and even praises to other deities. People also worship other fellow human beings, especially when that person means everything to them.</p><p class=align-left>Hence, worship can also be seen as an act of reverence and honour for someone or something in which a person places their faith.</p><h3>Bible verses about praise and worship</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ee976fdf18fd97df.jpg><p class=align-left>Here are some praise and <a href=#>worship scriptures</a> from the Bible.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c9a8b5d086dc3d9c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>“It’s not appropriate for Christians to participate in Davido, Wizkid concerts”: Joshua Mike Bamiloye says</span></p></a><ul><li>I will give thanks to you, Lord, with all my heart; I will tell of all your wonderful deeds.<i> - Psalm 9:1</i></li><li>About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.<i> - Acts 16:25</i></li><li>Through Jesus, therefore, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise-the fruit of lips that openly profess his name. <i>- Hebrews 13:15</i></li><li>Sing to the Lord, for he has done glorious things; let this be known to all the world. <i>- Isaiah 12:5</i></li><li>Lord, you are my God; I will exalt you and praise your name, for in perfect faithfulness, you have done wonderful things, things planned long ago.<i> - Isaiah 25:1</i></li><li>Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, saying: "To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honour and glory and power, forever and ever!". <i>- Revelation 5:13</i></li><li>Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts.
