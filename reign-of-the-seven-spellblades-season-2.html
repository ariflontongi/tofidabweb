The series is based on a light novel series of the same name written by Bokuto Uno and illustrated by Ruria Miyuki. The anime adaptation was produced by J.C.Staff and directed by Masato Matsune, with Shōgo Yasukawa as the scriptwriter and Kujira Yumemi as the music composer.</p><p>The story follows Oliver Horn, a young mage who enrolls in the prestigious Kimberly Magic Academy, where he forms a bond with a katana-wielding girl named Nanao Hibiya. However, Oliver has a hidden motive for attending the academy: he seeks revenge against the seven members of the faculty who were involved in the death of his mother, Chloe Halford, a legendary spellblade. As Oliver and Nanao face the dangers of the academy’s labyrinths, monsters, and secrets, they also discover the truth behind the seven spellblades that rule the world.</p><p>The anime series received positive reviews from critics and fans alike, who praised its stunning visuals, action-packed scenes, intriguing plot, and likable characters. The series also has a rating of 6.74 on MyAnimeList, based on over 30,000 votes. The series was simulcasted by Crunchyroll, which also licensed the series for streaming in North America, Europe, Australia, and other regions.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Will_There_Be_a_Season_2_of_Reign_of_the_Seven_Spellblades></span>Will There Be a Season 2 of Reign of the Seven Spellblades?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of November 06, 2023, <strong>there has been no official announcement regarding the renewal or cancellation of Reign of the Seven Spellblades Season 2</strong>. However, this does not mean that the series is doomed, as there are several factors that could influence the decision of the production committee.</p><p>One of the main factors is the source material availability. The light novel series, which began in September 2018, has 12 volumes published so far, with the latest one released in August 2023. The anime series covered the first four volumes of the light novel series, which means that there are eight more volumes left to be adapted. This is enough material for at least two more seasons of the anime series, assuming that the same pacing and quality are maintained.</p><p>Another factor is the popularity and profitability of the series. The anime series generated a lot of buzz and hype among the anime community, especially on social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube. The series also ranked among the top 10 most popular anime series on Crunchyroll during its airing period, according to the platform’s data.</p><p>The series also sold well in terms of Blu-ray and DVD sales, merchandise, and streaming revenue. According to Oricon, the first volume of the Blu-ray and DVD sold over 4,000 copies in its first week, which is a respectable number for a new anime series. The series also has a manga adaptation, which has seven volumes published so far and is licensed by Yen Press for an English release.</p><p>Based on these factors, we can conclude that Reign of the Seven Spellblades has a high chance of getting a second season, as it has enough source material, popularity, and profitability to warrant a continuation. However, the final decision ultimately depends on the production committee, which consists of various stakeholders such as the publisher, the studio, the broadcaster, and the licensor. Therefore, we can only hope that they will greenlight a second season soon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/When-Will-Season-2-of-Reign-of-the-Seven-Spellblades-Come-Out-2.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Reign_of_the_Seven_Spellblades_Season_2_Release_Date></span>Reign of the Seven Spellblades Season 2 Release Date<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>If we assume that Reign of the Seven Spellblades will get a second season, the next question is when will it come out? Unfortunately, there is no definitive answer to this question, as it depends on several factors such as the production schedule, the staff availability, the COVID-19 situation, and the anime industry trends.</p><p>However, based on some assumptions and comparisons, we can make an educated guess. Typically, a new season of an anime series takes at least a year or more to be produced, depending on the length, quality, and complexity of the series. For example, the second season of Re: Zero, another popular fantasy anime series based on a light novel series, took four years to come out after the first season, which aired in 2016.</p><p>However, this was an exceptional case, as the series had a lot of production issues and delays. A more realistic example would be the second season of That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, another fantasy anime series based on a light novel series, which took two years to come out after the first season, which aired in 2018.</p><p>Therefore, if we apply the same logic to Reign of the Seven Spellblades, <strong>we can expect </strong>Reign of the Seven Spellblades Season 2<strong> to come out sometime in 2024 or 2025</strong>, assuming that the production will start soon and that there will be no major issues or delays. Of course, this is just speculation, and the actual release date could be sooner or later than our estimate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/What-Will-Be-the-Plot-of-Season-2-of-Reign-of-the-Seven-Spellblades.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Plot></span>Plot<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The plot of the second season of Reign of the Seven Spellblades will most likely follow the events of the fifth to eighth volumes of the light novel series, which are titled “The Sword of the King”, “The Sword of the Hero”, “The Sword of the Demon”, and “The Sword of the God”. These volumes will continue the story of Oliver and Nanao as they face new challenges and enemies at Kimberly Magic Academy, as well as reveal more secrets and mysteries about the seven spellblades and their origins.</p><p>Some of the major plot points that we can expect to see in the Reign of the Seven Spellblades Season 2:</p><ul><li>Oliver and Nanao will participate in the Sword Festival, a tournament that pits the best swordsmen and swordswomen of the academy against each other. They will face off against other talented students, such as Carlos Whitrow, Ophelia Salvadori, and Vera Miligan, who are also the wielders of the other spellblades. They will also encounter a mysterious masked swordsman, who seems to have a connection to Oliver’s past.</li><li>Oliver and Nanao will learn more about the history and nature of the seven spellblades, which are actually fragments of the original spellblade, Excalibur, that was created by the ancient civilization of Atlantis. They will also discover the true identity and motive of the seventh spellblade, the Sword of the God, which is the most powerful and dangerous of all.</li><li>Oliver and Nanao will face the wrath of the seven faculty members, who are also the former wielders of the spellblades. They will learn the truth behind the death of Chloe Halford, and the reason why the faculty members betrayed her and tried to kill her son. They will also have to deal with the consequences of their actions, as they are branded as traitors and enemies of the academy and the world.</li></ul><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I’m Being Raised by Villains Chapter 45 Release Date</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cast></span>Cast<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tr><th>Character</th><th>Japanese Voice Actor</th><th>English Voice Actor</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>Oliver Horn</td><td>Atsushi Tamaru</td><td>Drew Breedlove</td></tr><tr><td>Nanao Hibiya</td><td>Yuka Nukui</td><td>Veronica Laux</td></tr><tr><td>Katie Aalto</td><td>Hitomi Oowada</td><td>Jill Harris</td></tr><tr><td>Guy Greenwood</td><td>Shinsuke Sugawara</td><td>Matthew Elkins</td></tr><tr><td>Michela McFarlane</td><td>Misuzu Yamada</td><td>Sara Ragsdale</td></tr><tr><td>Pete Reston</td><td>Riho Sugiyama</td><td>Lexi Nieto</td></tr><tr><td>Vera Miligan</td><td>Ai Kakuma</td><td>Kate Oxley</td></tr><tr><td>Carlos Whitrow</td><td>Kazutomi Yamamoto</td><td>Dallas Reid</td></tr><tr><td>Ophelia Salvadori</td><td>Ai Kayano</td><td>Robin Clayton</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_to_Watch></span>Where to Watch?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>If and when the second season of Reign of the Seven Spellblades comes out, it will most likely be available to watch on the same platforms as the first season. This means that the series will be simulcasted by Crunchyroll, which also has the exclusive streaming rights for the series in North America, Europe, Australia, and other regions. The series will also be broadcast on Tokyo MX and BS11 in Japan, and possibly on other channels in other countries.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Reign_of_the_Seven_Spellblades_Season_2_Spoiler></span>Reign of the Seven Spellblades Season 2 Spoiler <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>If you are curious about what will happen in the second season of Reign of the Seven Spellblades, and you don’t mind being spoiled, you can read the light novel series or the manga adaptation, which are ahead of the anime series in terms of the story. However, if you prefer to wait and watch the anime series without knowing anything in advance, you should avoid reading any spoilers online, as they might ruin your enjoyment and surprise.</p><p>Here are some of the major spoilers for the Reign of the Seven Spellblades Season 2, based on the light novel series:</p><ul><li>Oliver will win the Sword Festival, defeating Carlos, Ophelia, and Vera in the process. He will also unmask the mysterious swordsman, who turns out to be his childhood friend, Arthur Pendragon, the son of the king of Britannia and the wielder of the Sword of the King, the seventh spell blade.</li><li>Oliver learns that Arthur is actually his half-brother, as they share the same father, Uther Pendragon, the former king of Britannia and the former wielder of the Sword of the God. Uther was also the one who created the seven spellblades by breaking Excalibur into pieces, and he was the mastermind behind the death of Chloe Halford, who was his lover and the former wielder of the Sword of the Demon.</li><li>Oliver will also learn that Uther’s goal is to reunite the seven spellblades and recreate Excalibur, which will grant him the power to destroy the world and create a new one in his image. Uther will also reveal that he has implanted a curse in Oliver’s body, which will kill him if he does not surrender the Sword of the Demon to him.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrKynspmle6S7zGiYp6GdmnyzscigpWanlmLBqbGMrJyvnZ5iwLGxy6WZpZmUmsBuv8SaqqimXWd8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./sean-michaels-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Sean Michaels Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a>
