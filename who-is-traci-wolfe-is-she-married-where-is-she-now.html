Lethal Weapon 3 and Lethal Weapon 4 were released in 1992 and 1998 respectively.&nbsp;For her outstanding performance in the first film, she received the NAACP Image Award in 1989. It was thought that the special recognition award would motivate her to achieve more in the industry, but that did not happen.</span></p><p><span>Anyway, in the same year she made an appearance inone of the episodes of the American television series “In the heat of the night”.&nbsp;Since appearing in all four films of the Lethal Weapon series, she has made no further appearances and has not been featured in any other films or television series.</span></p><p><span>Although Traci Wolfe has retired from acting, she is still actively involved in commercial modeling which she started even before becoming an actress.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is she married?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Yes, the American actress model cum is currently married.&nbsp;There are no public records indicating who she is married to or details regarding the marriage.&nbsp;She managed to keep her private life very private by keeping a low profile.&nbsp;Her marriage is blessed with a child, and like other personal details in her life, the gender of her child has been left to speculation.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Where is she now?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Traci Wolfe has lived in many parts of the United States.&nbsp;She has lived in places like New Jersey, Virginia, Washington DC where she first worked as an assistant at a department store and in New York.&nbsp;Reports have been circulating that the 5ft 7in (1.7m) actress is living with her child and her husband in Maryland, USA.&nbsp;Although she lives in Maryland, she spends most of her time in New York and other cities around America working as a model for modeling outfits like Amerimark and Wilhelmina.&nbsp;She makes catalog models for women’s clothing.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMramam5lixLC4xZ5koqtdqLWmecyaqauhlZl6uLTEq5xmoaNiwKmxjKemsGc%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./yeonjun-txt.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is Yeonjun TXT?
