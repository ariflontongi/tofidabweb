He is the youngest of three sons of <strong>Thomas</strong> and <strong>Peggy Gallagher,</strong> who were Irish immigrants.</p><p>His father was a violent and abusive alcoholic who often beat his wife and children. <strong>Liam</strong> and his brothers, <strong>Noel Gallagher</strong> and <strong>Paul Anthony Gallagher,</strong> suffered from his father’s tyranny until their mother finally left him and took the boys with her when <strong>Liam</strong> was 12 years old. They moved to a council house in Ashburn Avenue, where Liam grew up.</p><p><strong>Liam</strong> was uninterested in school and often got into trouble for his bad behavior. He was expelled from the Barlow Roman Catholic High School at the age of 15 after fighting with another pupil.</p><p>He then attended the local college but dropped out after a year.</p><p>In his late teens, he developed a passion for music, influenced by bands such as The Beatles, The Who, The Stone Roses, The Jam, and The Sex Pistols.</p><p>He especially idolized John Lennon, whose image he adopted as his own. He also learned to play the tambourine, guitar, harmonica, and piano.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thecityceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Festival_des_Vieilles_Charrues_2018_-_Liam_Gallagher_-_013-217x300.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Personal_Life></span>Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Liam Gallagher</strong> has had a turbulent personal life, marked by several relationships, marriages, divorces, affairs, and children.</p><p>After dating her for two years, he married his first wife, actress <strong>Patsy Kensit</strong>, in 1997. They had a son, Lennon, named after John Lennon, in 1999.</p><p>However, their marriage was rocky and plagued by rumors of infidelity. <strong>Liam</strong> had an affair with singer Lisa Moorish in 1997, who gave birth to his daughter, Molly, in 1998.</p><p>He also had a brief fling with singer Dannii Minogue in 1998. <strong>Liam</strong> and <strong>Patsy</strong> divorced in 2000 after three years of marriage.</p><p>Liam then started dating Nicole Appleton, a girl group All Saints member, in 2000. They had a son, Gene, named after Gene Vincent, in 2001. They married in 2008 after eight years of living together.</p><p>Their marriage seemed stable and happy until it was revealed in 2013 that Liam had fathered a daughter, Gemma, with American journalist <strong>Liza Ghorbani</strong> after a one-night stand in 2010. After six years of marriage, this scandal led to Liam and Nicole’s divorce in 2014.</p><p><strong>Liam</strong> is engaged to <strong>Debbie Gwyther,</strong> his former personal assistant, whom he met in 2013. They have been together since 2014 and announced their engagement in 2019. They live in Hampstead, London, with Liam’s two cats, Sid and Nancy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thecityceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/TELEMMGLPICT000209191760_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqwBwu1L2eorE4h8CgqGiF4H59u5TJCe6wgxZxXNBbUvw-300x188.jpeg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span>Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Liam Gallagher</strong> began his musical career in 1991 when he joined a band called The Rain, formed by his school friends Paul McGuigan and Paul Arthurs.</p><p>He suggested changing the band’s name to Oasis, inspired by a poster of the Inspiral Carpets. He also invited his brother Noel to join the band as the lead guitarist and songwriter on the condition that he would have full control over the band’s musical direction. Noel agreed, and Oasis was born.</p><p>Oasis soon became one of the leading bands of the Britpop movement. This cultural phenomenon emerged in the mid-1990s, characterized by a revival of British guitar music and a sense of national pride.</p><p>Oasis’ debut album, Definitely Maybe, released in 1994, was a critical and commercial success, becoming the fastest-selling British debut album of all time.</p><p>It featured hit singles such as Supersonic, Live Forever, and Cigarettes & Alcohol, establishing Oasis as a major force in the British music scene.</p><p>Oasis’ second album, (What’s the Story) Morning Glory? Released in 1995, it was even more successful, reaching the top of the album charts in many countries and selling over 22 million copies worldwide.</p><p>It contained some of Oasis’ most iconic songs, such as Wonderwall, Don’t Look Back in Anger, Champagne Supernova, and Some Might Say. It also sparked a fierce rivalry with another Britpop band, Blur, who were seen as Oasis’ main competitors.</p><p>The two bands clashed in a media-fuelled “Battle of Britpop” in August 1995, when their respective singles, Roll with It by Oasis and Country House by Blur, were released on the same day. Blur won the chart battle, but Oasis won the war, as their album outsold Blur’s by a large margin.</p><p>Oasis’s third album, Be Here Now, released in 1997, was one of the most anticipated albums of the decade and became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history, selling over 420,000 copies on the first day of release.</p><p>However, it received mixed reviews from critics, who criticized its excessive length, overproduction, and lack of originality. It also marked the beginning of Oasis’ decline in popularity, as Britpop faded away and new musical trends emerged.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thecityceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/4_Liam-Gallegher-in-concert-300x232.webp><p>Oasis continued to release albums throughout the 2000s, but none matched the success or impact of their first three.</p><p>They also faced several problems, such as line-up changes, legal battles, drug abuse, and, most importantly, the growing tension between Liam and Noel, who often argued and fought over creative differences, personal issues, and public insults.</p><p>Their relationship reached a breaking point in August 2009, when Noel quit the band after a violent backstage altercation with Liam just before a scheduled concert in Paris.</p><p>He announced his departure in a statement, saying: “It is with some sadness and great relief…I quit Oasis tonight. People will write and say what they like, but I could not continue working with Liam a day longer.”</p><p>After Noel’s departure, Liam and the remaining members of Oasis decided to continue as a new band called Beady Eye, with Liam as the lead singer and songwriter.</p><p>They released two albums, Different Gear, Still Speeding in 2011, and BE in 2013, but both received lukewarm responses from critics and fans and failed to achieve commercial success. Beady Eye disbanded in 2014 after four years of existence.</p><p>Liam began a solo career, signing a record deal with Warner Bros. Records in 2016. He released his debut solo album, As You Were, in 2017, which proved to be a critical and commercial success.</p><p>It topped the UK Albums Chart and was the ninth fastest-selling debut album of the 2010s in the UK, with over 103,000 units sold in its first week.</p><p>It also received positive reviews from critics, who praised Liam’s vocals, songwriting, and charisma. It featured singles like Wall of Glass, For What It’s Worth, and Come Back to Me.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thecityceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/jonh-squire-liam-gallagher-300x180.jpg><p>Liam’s second solo album, Why Me? Why Not, released in 2019, received mostly positive reviews and topped the UK charts.</p><p>This made it his tenth chart-topping album, including eight with Oasis, and it also became the fastest-selling vinyl of 2019. It contained singles such as Shockwave, Once, and Now That I’ve Found You.</p><p>Liam has also performed live as a solo artist, headlining several festivals and concerts worldwide. He has also collaborated with artists such as Gorillaz, The Prodigy, and The Who.</p><p>He has also been involved in various charitable causes, such as the One Love Manchester concert, the Teenage Cancer Trust, and War Child.</p><p>Liam is regarded as one of the greatest frontmen of all time and one of British rock music’s most influential and charismatic figures.</p><p>He has received several awards and accolades, including the NME Godlike Genius Award, the Q Icon Award, the MTV Europe Music Award for Rock Icon, and the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. He has also been nominated for the Mercury Prize, the Ivor Novello Award, and the Grammy Award.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Net_Worth></span>Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Liam Gallagher</strong> has an estimated net worth of $60 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p>He has earned his fortune from his music career as a member of Oasis and a solo artist. He also has endorsement deals with brands like Adidas, Pretty Green, and Burberry.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Controversies></span>Controversies<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Liam Gallagher</strong> has been involved in many controversies throughout his career, both on and off the stage.</p><p>He has been known for his outspoken and often offensive remarks, his violent and erratic behavior, and his legal troubles. Some of the most notable controversies are:</p><p>He was arrested in 1994 for possession of cocaine after a raid at a London nightclub. He was fined £600 and given a conditional discharge.</p><p>He was involved in a brawl with a group of fans in Munich in 2002, which resulted in him losing his two front teeth and being arrested for assault.</p><p>He was fined €50,000 and banned from entering Germany for a year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thecityceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Liam-Gallagher-2022-billboard-1548-300x198.webp><p>Several women sued him for child support, including <strong>Lisa Moorish, Liza Ghorbani,</strong> and<strong> Lillie Huddy</strong>. He has reportedly paid millions of pounds in settlements and alimony to his ex-wives and former lovers.</p><p>He was accused of cheating on his second wife, <strong>Nicole Appleton,</strong> with several women, including singer <strong>Lily Allen,</strong> journalist <strong>Liza Ghorbani,</strong> and actress <strong>Sienna Miller.</strong> He denied the allegations but later admitted having a daughter, <strong>Gemma,</strong> with <strong>Ghorbani.</strong></p><p>He was involved in a long-running feud with his older brother, <strong>Noel Gallagher,</strong> which led to the breakup of Oasis and several lawsuits.</p><p>The brothers have not spoken to each other since 2009 and have publicly insulted and mocked each other on various occasions. Liam has also criticized Noel’s solo work and accused him of stealing his songs.</p><p>He was sued by his former Beady Eye bandmate, Andy Bell, for breach of contract in 2016. Bell claimed that Liam owed him £500,000 in unpaid royalties and fees. The case was settled out of court in 2017.</p><p>He was arguing with actor Idris Elba at the NME Awards 2013. He allegedly threw a drink at Elba and tried to grab his hat. Elba reportedly responded by ruffling Liam’s hair and pushing him away. The incident was caught on camera and went viral on social media.</p><p>He was involved in a scuffle with a security guard at the Glastonbury Festival in 2019. He allegedly tried to force his way into a backstage area where his girlfriend, <strong>Debbie Gwyther,</strong> was waiting for him.</p><p>He was stopped by the guard, who pushed him back and told him to calm down. Liam reacted by swearing and shouting at the guard before being escorted away by his entourage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thecityceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/images-9.jpeg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Social_Media></span>Social Media<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Instagram handle: @liamgallagher</li><li>Twitter handle: @liamgallagher</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Discography></span>Discography<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Wall of Glass</li><li>For What It’s Worth</li><li>Greedy Soul</li><li>Come Back to Me</li><li>Shockwave</li><li>One of Us</li><li>Now That I’ve Found Yo</li><li>Once</li><li>Everything’s Electric</li><li>Better Days</li></ul><h5>NOTICE!!
