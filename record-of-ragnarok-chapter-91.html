The chapter showed how Liu Bei used his secret weapon, the Eight Geniuses, to counter Apollo’s overwhelming power. The Eight Geniuses were the eight loyal advisers and generals of Liu Bei, who sacrificed their lives to become his Volund, the Valkyrie Thrud.</p><p>With their help, Liu Bei was able to unleash a powerful attack called the Eight Formation, which pierced through Apollo’s solar armor and struck his heart. Apollo was shocked and impressed by Liu Bei’s courage and loyalty, and admitted his defeat before falling to the ground. Liu Bei then collapsed as well, having exhausted his life force.
