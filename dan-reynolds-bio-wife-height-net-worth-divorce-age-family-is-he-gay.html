songwriting, record production and multiple instruments.&nbsp;Reynolds is best known as the frontman for the Las Vegas-based rock band Imagine Dragons.&nbsp;Meanwhile, pursuing a career in music has been Reynolds’ toughest life decision, considering he comes from a family of academics.&nbsp;He rose to the challenge and grew into one of the rock musicians the world can count on.&nbsp;In 2014 he received the prestigious Hall of Fame award for songwriter Hal David Starlight.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Dan Reynolds’ Bio (Age)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Dan Reynolds was born on July 14, 1987 in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States.&nbsp;His full name is Daniel Coulter Reynolds.&nbsp;He is one of the nine children (one girl and eight boys) of Ronald and Christene Reynolds.&nbsp;As the seventh child, Dan has six older and two younger siblings.</span></p><p><span>Dan Reynolds grew up in Las Vegas, where he also attended Bonanza High School in the Las Vegas Valley.&nbsp;Meanwhile, he started playing music at the age of 12.&nbsp;He also joined the Boy Scout and at 18 achieved the rank of Eagle Scout.&nbsp;that was in 2005.</span></p><p><span>After high school, Reynolds enrolled at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.&nbsp;At age 19, Dan, who attended The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), joined the Mormon missionary in Nebraska and served as a full-time volunteer for two years.&nbsp;He did this primarily to escape the numerous difficulties his burgeoning musical career threw him into.&nbsp;After his missionary service, Reynolds transferred to Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.&nbsp;Despite his good academic results, Dan couldn’t take his eyes off the music.</span></p><p><span>Although Reynolds initially had no intention of making music a career, his passion for the art continued to grow, leading him to form the rock band Imagine Dragons in 2008.&nbsp;He and his group won BYU’s “Battle of the Bands” competition.&nbsp;Following this, Reynolds, who discovered he could do nothing but make music, dropped out of school to pursue a full-time musical career.</span></p><h3><strong><span>music career</span></strong></h3><p><span>Upon leaving BYU, Dan Reynolds and his bandmates moved to Las Vegas, where they performed at nighttime events.&nbsp;The band soon landed their big break in 2010 when the lead singer of San Francisco rock band Train fell ill ahead of the Bite of Las Vegas festival.&nbsp;Train then asked Imagine Dragons to perform for them during the festival, which was attended by more than 26,000 spectators.&nbsp;this is how they shoot into the limelight.</span></p><p><span>In 2011, Imagine Dragons signed to InterscopeRecords, where they began working under famed record producer Alexander Grant.&nbsp;Soon after, they released their debut single titled It’s Time in August 2012, followed by their studio album It’s Time.&nbsp;</span><span>Night vision</span><span>&nbsp;in September 2012.&nbsp;</span><span>Night vision</span><span>It turned out to be a huge hit, earning the band many awards including Grammy’s Best Rock Performance, Teen Choice Awards Choice Rock Group, World Music Awards World Best Rock Act and so on.&nbsp;“Radioactive” was the album’s biggest hit, peaking at number one on Billboard’s Rock Songs chart for 23 weeks, number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 87 weeks and earning Diamond certification from the RIAA.</span></p><p><span>In 2015, Reynolds and his band came out with their second album,&nbsp;</span><span>Rauch + Spiegel</span><span>&nbsp;, with “I Bet My Life” and “Shots” as the most popular singles.&nbsp;The band followed with their third album,&nbsp;</span><span>Evolving</span><span>&nbsp;Of all the album’s singles, the most successful were “Thunder”, “Believer” and “Whatever It Takes”.&nbsp;In 2018, Imagine released Dragons&nbsp;</span><span>Origins</span><span>&nbsp;, their fourth studio album.&nbsp;That same year, the band won the iHeartRadio award for Alternative Rock Artist of the Year, in addition to two Grammy nominations.</span></p><p><span>Still a member of Imagine Dragons and signed to Interscope Records, Dan Reynolds founded the Night Street Records label in 2016.&nbsp;Following this, Reynolds launched LOVELOUD, an annual charity festival aimed at promoting acceptance of LGBT youth and curbing teen suicide.&nbsp;The first version of the festival took place on August 26, 2017 in Orem, Utah.&nbsp;The second was held in Salt Lake City on July 28, 2018, and the governor finally declared the date “Loveloud Day” in Utah.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is Dan Reynolds gay, divorced?&nbsp;Or does he have a wife and a family?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Dan Reynolds is not gay.&nbsp;Reynolds only sparked gay rumors when he began showing support for LGBT communities through his LOVELOUD movement.&nbsp;On the contrary, Dan has a wife – Aja Volkman, fellow rocker and lead singer of Nico Vega.&nbsp;They married on March 5, 2011.</span></p><p><span>Reynolds met Volkman in 2010 when Imagine Dragons opened for Nico Vega, an indie rock band.&nbsp;The two became friends after Reynolds asked Volkman to help him with some demos he was working on at the time.&nbsp;They then formed a musical duo called “Egyptian” under which they independently released a four-track eponymous digital EP.</span></p><p><span>Dan Reynolds has three children with Aja Volkman – all girls.&nbsp;Their first daughter, Arrow Eve Reynolds, was born on August 18, 2012.&nbsp;The couple welcomed a group of twin girls – Gia and Coco – on March 28, 2017.</span></p><p><span>After the birth of their twins, Reynolds and Volkman announced they were planning a divorce, which got fans curious.&nbsp;However, the divorce didn’t materialize, as the first revealed on the release of Imagine Dragons’ single “Bad Liar” on November 6, 2018 that they have made up their differences.&nbsp;The reconciled couple later announced that they are expecting their fourth child and first son in October 2019.</span></p><p><strong><span>See Also: Papa Yankees Bio, Age, Net worth, Height, Is He Gay?</span></strong></p><h2><strong><span>What is Dan Reynolds
