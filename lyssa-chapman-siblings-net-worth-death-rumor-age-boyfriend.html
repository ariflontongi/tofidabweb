Rumor, Age, Boyfriend</h1><div id=sub-header>August 2024 · 4 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><span>Lyssa Chapman is an American businesswoman, former slave, and former bounty hunter.&nbsp;She is famous for her role in the A&E TV series&nbsp;</span><span>“Dog the Bounty Hunter”.</span></p><p><span>At 14, she became pregnant with her first child.&nbsp;she revealed that she had been sexually abused.&nbsp;The 24-year-old offender was arrested and found guilty of sexually abusing a minor.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Biography of Lyssa Chapman</span></strong></h2><p><span>Lyssa Rae Chapman was born on the 10th&nbsp;</span><span>day</span><span>&nbsp;of June 1987 in Denver, Colorado, United States;&nbsp;to Mother Lyssa Rae Brittan and Father Duane ‘Dog’ Chapman.&nbsp;His mother is his father’s third wife and she is the ninth of his father’s twelve children.</span></p><p><span>She was raised by her father until she was ten years old and moved with her mother to a small town in Alaska after her parents’ marriage collapsed.</span></p><p><span>Lyssa Chapman had her daughter Abbie Mae Chapman at the age of fifteen and to everyone’s surprise, she refused to press charges against her attacker.&nbsp;She expressed her gratitude to him for giving him a daughter.</span></p><h2><strong><span>dog the bounty hunter</span></strong></h2><p><span>She participated in her father’s TV show&nbsp;</span><span>“Dog the Bounty Hunter”</span><span>&nbsp;which is an American reality series aired by A&E at the time.&nbsp;The show ceased airing in 2012 after eight seasons and 246 episodes.&nbsp;It was about their experiences as bounty hunters and how they managed to track down and capture fugitives wanted in the system or prisoners who violated their parole.</span></p><p><span>Lyssa Chapman became a licensed bounty hunter at age 19.&nbsp;She also worked with her father at the family surety company.&nbsp;Da Kine Bonds after reuniting six years later.</span></p><h2><strong><span>What is Lyssa Chapman doing now?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Currently, she no longer works with her father and no longer appears on her father’s show.&nbsp;She is said to be a businesswoman now and that is all we currently know about her career and relationships.</span></p><p><span>At 23, Lyssa Chapman is pregnant with her second child as she was dating the child’s father.&nbsp;they loved each other very much.&nbsp;They had their daughter Madalynn Grace Galanti on 7&nbsp;</span><span>th</span><span>&nbsp;August 2009 and we found out that he also has a daughter from his previous relationship.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Lyssa Chapman’s relationship with Brahman Galanti</span></strong></h2><p><span>In February 2009, Lyssa and Brahman ‘Bo’ Galanti tied the knot in Ko Olina, Oahu, Hawaii and they were happy or so we thought.&nbsp;Unfortunately, it was reported that she was physically and mentally abused throughout their marriage and sometimes ran out of the house in the middle of the night to go to her father because she was afraid of Galanti.</span></p><p><span>However, in 2011, Lyssa had had enough of the abuse and decided to file for divorce and they went their separate ways.&nbsp;She is currently divorced and lives with her two daughters.&nbsp;Abbie Mae Chapman and Madalynn Grace Galanti.&nbsp;Ideally, that’s not a good thing to see, especially for growing kids, but we guess their separation was the best way to go.</span></p><p><span>Lyssa Chapman was arrested for assaulting a police officer and damaging criminal property on March 15th&nbsp;</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;2011.</span></p><p><span>In 2013, she wrote a book called “Autobiography”.&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Walking on Eggshells: The Lyssa Chapman Story</span></strong><span>.&nbsp;In this book, she explained and revealed events in her life.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net worth and siblings of Lyssa Chapman</span></strong></h2><p><span>Although the time when she participated in her father’s TV show and her current business activities, Lyssa’s net worth is estimated to be around $500,000.</span></p><p><span>There isn’t much information about his family or siblings;&nbsp;we know that she is the daughter of her father’s third wife and the ninth child out of twelve.</span></p><p><span>A tragic event shook her in 2006; when she lost her sister Barbara in a car accident, reports said her sister had died from her injuries.&nbsp;She admitted that it had affected her a lot.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Lyssa Chapman Death Rumor</span></strong></h2><p><span>In September 2012, it was reported that LyssaChapman was involved in a serious car accident in Honolulu and she was with her daughters.&nbsp;However, there were no reports of the extent of the injuries at this time but apparently they lived through it and it was a scary time for the family as they also lost their sister Barbara in a car accident .</span></p><p><span>Her mother told TMZ: “Little Lyssa had an accident and all of our girls were in the car.</span></p><p class=postsid
