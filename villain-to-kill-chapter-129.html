He was friends with Leo, a fellow psyker who had the power of telepathy. They had a close bond and trusted each other.</p><p>One day, they were assigned to a mission to stop a villain named Heretic, who was planning to destroy the world with a nuclear bomb. They infiltrated his base and fought against his minions, but they were ambushed and captured. Heretic revealed that he had a mole in the Justice League, and that he knew everything about their plan. He then showed them a video of their friend, Alice, who was also a psyker and a member of the Justice League.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Villain-To-Kill-Chapter-129-spoiler-.jpg><p>Cassian and Leo were shocked and enraged by her words. They tried to break free from their chains, but they were too weak and injured. Heretic then activated the nuclear bomb, and said that he would kill them and the world. He said that he hated psykers, and that he wanted to create a new world order, where only villains would rule.</p><p>He said that he had a special power, that allowed him to manipulate reality and time. He said that he had used his power to create a parallel world, where he had reincarnated as a villain, and where he had manipulated the fate of Cassian and Leo. He said that he had made Cassian a villain, and Leo a psyker, and that he had made them enemies. He said that he had enjoyed watching them suffer and fight, and that he had planned to kill them again in that world.</p><p>The chapter then switches to the present, where Cassian is lying on the ground, bleeding from his chest. He is surrounded by his friends, who are also injured and unconscious. His sister, who is Heretic’s sister, is standing over him, holding the weapon that stabbed him.
