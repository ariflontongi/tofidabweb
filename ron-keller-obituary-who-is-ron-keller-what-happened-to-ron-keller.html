Born into a family deeply embedded in Naperville’s musical heritage – such as great-grandfather Joseph Bapst being director of the band during its late 19th Century heyday – his musical roots continued with parents who also long stood with this group. Ron’s love of music started young: it began while walking his dog around neighborhood parks with his aunt when his aunt led him into discovering an unexpected sousaphone which ultimately sealed his musical destiny!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Did Keller Start His Journey with the Naperville Municipal Band?</h2><p>Keller first set his sights on becoming leader of the Naperville Municipal Band since elementary school, which he had been part of since grade school. As fifth generation member to join, he first took center stage as a soloist before eventually transitioning into tuba section membership under Elmer Koerner, then director. While studying at Northern Illinois University Keller not only participated but led a marching band while maintaining strong ties with Naperville band.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Role Did Keller Play in the Development of the Naperville Municipal Band?</h2><p>Keller’s vision for the band was audience-centric, focused on providing music that resonated with its community. His approach became a hallmark of his tenure as director beginning in 1966. Together with Ann Lord – Mistress of Ceremonies and childhood friend – and directorship, he helped mold it into what it is today, working closely together so each performance was not simply musical but instead an enjoyable social experience for its attendees.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Can You Explain the Significance of Naperville Municipal Band’s Fourth of July Concerts?</h2><p>Since 1977, the Naperville Municipal Band’s Fourth of July concert has become an annual tradition under Keller’s direction. Under his watchful guidance, Keller would perform the 1812 Overture featuring local church bells and cannons – in response to former mayor Chester Rybicki requesting this performance – complete with howitzers for authentic cannon sounds that demonstrated his dedication to providing extraordinary musical experiences for audiences.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What was Keller’s Impact upon Retirement and Who Succeeded Him?</h2><p>On August 10, 2023, Keller concluded his remarkable 71-year journey with the Naperville Municipal Band by handing the baton off to Emily Binder – one of his former students from Waubonsie Valley High School who went on to become its assistant director before taking over full control. Her goal is to honor and carry forward Keller’s legacy while acknowledging his tremendous impactful contributions through music as mentorship.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Does the Community Recognize Ron Keller’s Contributions?</h2><p>In recognition of Ron Keller’s enormous contributions, Naperville City Council honored him shortly after he retired on August 15, 2023 by renaming Central Park Road “Ron Keller Commemorative Way”, paying homage to someone who dedicated their life to music and community service. Ron Keller was known to go out with style – this tribute marks an end of an era.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Will Ron Keller Leave Behind in Naperville?</h2><p>Ron Keller passed away peacefully at age 84 on January 24th 2024 and will leave behind an everlasting legacy in Naperville. His work with the Naperville Municipal Band for seven decades will long be remembered; along with his leadership role over that time. Keller’s desire that future generations enjoy their musical heritage contributed by him is evidence of his lasting dedication to music and its people of Naperville; this sentiment will certainly live on long after he is no longer here.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbjAp5ylpJmdsrOty51lnKedZH53g5hvZqunnmK4prjLnqlmp5Kewbat0bJksKCfYra0edGopWajlaG5pr6MsJ%2BarF2drrG8xKecnWWkpHqzu81mop6knJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./royal-style-watch-july-2024-queen-mary-duchess-sophie.html>&#171;&nbsp;Royal Style Watch: from Queen Mary's gold gown to Duchess Sophie's cinched dress</a>
