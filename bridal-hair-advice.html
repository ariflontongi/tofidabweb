And, after you find “the dress,” thinking about how you’ll style the look is up next. Accessories come first (you’ll need the shoes for your first fitting, jewelry at your second, and the full look for the third), but beauty should follow suit, and be dictated by your personal style, your neckline, and what will make for jaw-dropping photo moments. Selecting your wedding hair look can feel daunting, and is often a customized, individual process. Some brides opt for waist-length extensions, while others opt to shave it all off (like yours truly) The truth: There’s no wrong way to look on one of the most exciting and romantic days of your life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">From picking the right hairstyle to figuring out when to touch-up your roots, we tapped four mega- celebrity hair stylists for the best bridal prep advice you’ll ever receive.</p><img alt="christy baird wedding hair" title="christy baird wedding hair" width=980 height=1470 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/christy-baird-brian-doxtator-sarah-falugo-wedding-113-1531258272.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Sarah Falugo</span></p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Your Hair Health</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you're still a few months out and think your hair could use a little oomph, try popping a daily vitamin with biotin.

Your hair will shine, and you can see how your hair manipulates after the detox,” he explains. “For example, you might want to do a detox two days before your wedding and then follow up with your regular shampoo the day of your wedding so that your hair will react to the curling iron, blow dryer, or updo the way you pictured it when you did your test run.” Naturally, Garren is a fan of R+Co’s new <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.randco.com/super-garden-shampoo-conditioner-set data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SUPER GARDEN CBD Shampoo & Conditioner" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>SUPER GARDEN CBD Shampoo & Conditioner</u></a>. “The combo is also great for detoxing the hair.

You can’t go wrong with a classic look on your wedding day.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you are looking to go for the chop, do it because you know your soon-to-be spouse (and you) are sure to love it. Believe it or not, some brides (and grooms) love a bridal look without long locks. “This is rare, but I’ve had a couple brides that have said their future husband really love them with a short haircut. [These brides] deliberately grew their hair out so they could surprise their [partner] with short hair walking down the aisle.” The catch? “[The bride] always knew what she looked like with that cut—and had it already once before. She’s already thought it all out and purchased a dress to match the cut.” In short: Go short; but only if you know without a doubt that it’s a look you love on yourself. Your wedding day is not the time to experiment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But, we get it—things happen. If you absolutely hate your haircut, the world is not over; we promise. For those looking to correct a short chop, “I would absolutely recommend extensions,” adds Marjan. “This is the best quick solution for a bad haircut and exactly why I don’t recommend any hair changes leading up to a wedding. Your stylist should be able to work with clip-ins if you want a temporary solution for the ceremony.”</p><img alt="diipa khosla pre wedding hair look for haldi ceremony" title="diipa khosla pre wedding hair look for haldi ceremony" width=2400 height=3600 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/5m4-8263-1594324449.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Zohaib Ali</span></p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Landing on Your Hair Color</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Switching up or fine-tuning the color of your hair sounds tempting, but it can be a nightmare when you're just days away from walking down the aisle. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/nikkilee901/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nikki Lee" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Nikki Lee</u></a>, encourages her brides to finalize their hair color goals at least 6-weeks prior to their nuptials. “This allows time for things to settle in and makes sure [you’re certain that] this is the hair color you truly want for your wedding day. It will also give you time to try on your dress with that hair color to make sure it’s right.” This is sage advice, considering that hair color can ultimately sway the styling and decision making surrounding your final bridal look, and whether you choose to don a dress in color for the reception, after party, or even the aisle.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But if you are staying consistent and keeping your current shade, plan on booking a hair color touch-up a week out from your big day. “You will have a lot on your plate, so your hair color should be the least of your worries,” explains Lee. “Try not to wash your hair too many times in the days leading up to the wedding to keep your tone the same. You can bring products like a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/hair/g12655840/purple-shampoo/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="purple shampoo" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>purple shampoo</u></a> and a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com.sg/beauty/bazaar-hair-awards-2019-best-masks-and-supplements/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="hair mask" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>hair mask</u></a> with you to keep your hair looking fresh.

Think about hairstyles you may look back on in 10 years and think - ‘what was I thinking?’” Redway also noted that your look’s fabrication is key to landing on a hairstyle choice.Ruffles and frills towards the neckline will likely catch on long hair, and beadwork poses its own set of considerations—”you wouldn’t want your hair to get tangled into the beading,” she notes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For Garren, it really depends on the <u>neckline</u> of the dress. If your gown is a high-neck, consider sweeping your hair up. If the silhouette is sleek and minimal, complement that vibe with an equally slick center part and hair behind the ears, or consider softening the look with loose waves. It’s also about what makes you look your best overall, Garren explains, and that doesn’t necessarily require an idea that’s overwrought. “Sometimes, something very simple is effective. If you look beautiful with your hair pulled back in a pony and it makes you really glow, why not do a sleek ponytail? If it’s more of a relaxed wedding, I would recommend the hair down or in a messy bun that also looks put together–almost like she did it herself, but there’s structure.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Given that it is a wedding, after all, it’s important to consider elements of polish and refinement, even in no-fuss moments. “I think it looks nice when there’s some kind of nod to formality–[maybe] the top is pulled back, or there’s a slicked-back center part and the hair is tucked behind the ears, or it’s all down and really groomed,” adds Garren who styled <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/bazaar-brides/news/g37985/hannah-bronfman-brendan-fallis-wedding/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hannah Bronfman Fallis" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Hannah Bronfman Fallis</u></a>’ hair during her wedding festivities in Marrakech.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Redway suggests if you’re wearing your hair down on your wedding day, you’ll want to make sure your strands are prepped to combat the environment. “[Ask your stylist] to prep your hair before styling with the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.target.com/p/nexxus-mousse-plus-volumizing-foam-10-6oz/-/A-10227519?ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&AFID=google_pla_df&fndsrc=tgtao&CPNG=PLA_Beauty%2BPersonal+Care%2BShopping_Local&adgroup=SC_Health%2BBeauty&LID=700000001170770pgs&network=g&device=c&location=1023102&ds_rl=1246978&ds_rl=1248099&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIx9aFht-46gIVC9bACh2-NgZmEAYYAyABEgL78_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nexxus Mousse Plus Volumizing Foam" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Nexxus Mousse Plus Volumizing Foam</u></a> and blow dry the product into your hair,” she advises. “Adding mousse will allow your style to withstand the elements a lot easier than it would on freshly-washed hair.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now that more brides are opting to don their natural hair down the aisle, caring for your curls (and maintaining hair health) is even more important. “Brides with curly and textured hair should prep their hair with leave-in conditioners, and products that aid against frizz and humidity,” shares Redway. For those looking to style natural curls, some starter ideas from Redway include a half-up look, pinning the sides back, or adding braids and flowers to complement your hair texture. For those looking for a little something extra, chic hair accessories aren’t just for straight locks and soft waves, and are a great option to dress up and enhance textured hair.</p><img alt="bride running away in capri" title="bride running away in capri" width=980 height=1470 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/carriesselectscapri-shawnconnell-015-jpg-1558040883.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Shawn Connell</span></p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>Choosing Your Hairstylist</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Do the legwork and select a stylist you feel 100% confident working with. Garren suggests starting with your wedding planner (if you have one) for stylists suggestions.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Redway mirrors these sentiments. “[Definitely] meet your stylist in person before your wedding day and do a hair trial (or two) in advance. Bring inspirational photos and listen to how they speak about the service they provide to see if they feel confident about performing it,” she explains. “Also, ask for photos of real clients they have worked on before. Pay attention to the way they handle your hair in the consultation.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Setting expectations are also key. <strong>“</strong>When I’m doing a wedding, I first find out what the client expects of me,” explains Garren. “Then, we have to determine what the hair is for, if it’s just for the wedding day, the night before, the day after, a lunch in between, etc. You need to take a lot of things into consideration for a wedding: the overall feeling and theme (ask yourself: Is it a formal event? Or more casual and relaxed?), if it’s indoor or outdoor, your gown(s) and neckline(s), if you’re wearing a veil or headpiece, and so on.” Keep in mind that all these conversations and questions can happen in advance, once you’ve chosen a gown and a location for your ceremony and reception.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Heed this advice if nothing else: Book a hair trial. “There should never be a situation where it’s the morning of the wedding and you have no idea what your hair is going to look like,” Garren emphasizes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Marjan agrees that a hair trial is key and can save any major wedding day hair heartbreak. “I almost always suggest a trial so there aren’t any surprises and miscommunications the day-of—unless you really trust the person you are working with. This is your opportunity to express exactly what you want so you can focus on other things the morning of your wedding,” she adds.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On the day of, consider booking your hair stylist on hand for all day coverage, especially if you plan to change into a reception gown or after party look that may require a different hair style. If you haven't booked a hairstylist for the entire day, ask to have a few hair products nearby for touch ups, and consult with your stylist on how to use those products during your hair trials. “A little mini can of hairspray, bobby pins, and a smoothing brush like the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/Wet-Brush-Shine-Hair-Purple/dp/B00EW9F2X0 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="WetBrush Shine Enhancer" data-vars-ga-product-id=83274e97-d72a-46e5-9436-27dd054f860c data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/Wet-Brush-Shine-Hair-Purple/dp/B00EW9F2X0 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/Wet-Brush-Shine-Hair-Purple/dp/B00EW9F2X0 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/Wet-Brush-Shine-Hair-Purple/dp/B00EW9F2X0 data-affiliate-network='{"id":"7f0216f7-084f-4dc8-9190-07ae7162064c","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=0f954ddd-0ae7-4d77-9799-76d40423f693 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090"><u>WetBrush Shine Enhancer</u></a> can easily fit in a purse for touch-ups,” adds Marjan.
