Eggs will leach the calcium into the soil for root uptake during composting, which can conquer such problems as blossom end rot.<h2>Is baking soda good for growing tomatoes?</h2>Although it seems silly, this simple garden trick really works. The baking soda absorbs into the soil and lowers its acidity levels giving you tomatoes that are more sweet than tart.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8CrnGadl5x6tLTEpaOsZZekvKV5xaipZqyfoq61u8Ss</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bridal-hair-advice.html>&#171;&nbsp;Best Wedding Day Hair Advice</a>
